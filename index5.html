      The iPhone is a line of smartphones produced by Apple Inc. which uses
      Apple's own iOS mobile operating system. The first-generation iPhone was
      announced by then-Apple CEO Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then,
      Apple has annually released new iPhone models and iOS updates. <br />
      As of November 1, 2018, more than 2.2 billion iPhones had been sold. As of
      2022, the iPhone accounts for 15.6% of global smartphone market share.

      The iPhone was the first mobile phone with multi-touch technology. Since
      the iPhone's launch, it gained larger screen sizes, video-recording,
      waterproofing, and many accessibility features. Up to iPhone 8 and 8 Plus,
      iPhones had a single button on the front panel with the Touch ID
      fingerprint sensor. <br />
      Since iPhone X, iPhone models have switched to a nearly bezel-less front
      screen design with Face ID facial recognition, and app switching activated
      by gestures. Touch ID is still used for the budget iPhone SE series.

      The iPhone is one of the two largest smartphone platforms in the world
      alongside Android, and is a large part of the luxury market. The iPhone
      has generated large profits for Apple, making it one of the world's most
      valuable publicly traded companies. The first-generation iPhone was
      described as a "revolution" for the mobile phone industry and subsequent
      models have also garnered praise. <br />
      The iPhone has been credited with popularizing the smartphone and slate
      form factor, and with creating a large market for smartphone apps, or "app
      economy". As of January 2017, Apple's App Store contained more than 2.2
      million applications for the iPhone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Development of an Apple smartphone began in 2004, when Apple started to
      gather a team of 1,000 employees led by hardware engineer Tony Fadell,
      software engineer Scott Forstall, and design officer Jony Ive,[6] to work
      on the highly confidential "Project Purple".
    </p>
    <p>
      Then-Apple CEO Steve Jobs steered the original focus away from a tablet
      (which was later revisited in the form of the iPad) towards a phone.[9]
      Apple created the device during a secretive collaboration with Cingular
      Wireless (later renamed AT&T Mobility) at the timeâ€”at an estimated
      development cost of US$150 million over thirty months.[10] According to
      Jobs in 1998, the "i" word in "iMac" (and therefore "iPod", "iPhone" and
      "iPad") stands for internet, individual, instruct, inform, and inspire.

      Apple rejected the "design by committee" approach that had yielded the
      Motorola ROKR E1, a largely unsuccessful "iTunes phone" made in
      collaboration with Motorola. Among other deficiencies, the ROKR E1's
      firmware limited storage to only 100 iTunes songs to avoid competing with
      Apple's iPod nano.Cingular gave Apple the liberty to develop the iPhone's
      hardware and software in-house, a rare practice at the time,and paid Apple
      a fraction of its monthly service revenue (until the iPhone 3G), in
      exchange for four years of exclusive U.S. sales, until 2011.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jobs unveiled the first-generation iPhone to the public on January 9,
      2007, at the Macworld 2007 convention at the Moscone Center in San
      Francisco.[19] The iPhone incorporated a 3.5-inch multi-touch display with
      few hardware buttons, and ran the iPhone OS operating system with a
      touch-friendly interface, then marketed as a version of Mac OS X. It
      launched on June 29, 2007, at a starting price of US$499 in the United
      States, and required a two-year contract with AT&T.
    </p>
    <p>
      On July 11, 2008, at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2008,
      Apple announced the iPhone 3G, and expanded its launch-day availability to
      twenty-two countries, and it was eventually released in 70 countries and
      territories. The iPhone 3G introduced faster 3G connectivity, and a lower
      starting price of US$199 (with a two-year AT&T contract). Its successor,
      the iPhone 3GS, was announced on June 8, 2009, at WWDC 2009, and
      introduced video recording functionality.
