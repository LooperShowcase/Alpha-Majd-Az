      Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve
      Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a partnership. <br />
      The company's first product was the Apple I, a computer designed and
      hand-built entirely by Wozniak.
    </p>
    As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the
    1990s,<br />
    Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the
    Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also known as
    "Wintel").

      As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the
      1990s, Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of
      the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also
      known as "Wintel"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company
      bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system strategy and
      entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple
      back to profitability through a number of tactics including introducing
      the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching "Think
      different" and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple
      Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the
      company's product portfolio.
      <br />
      When Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later,
      he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company
      developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces,
      including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically
      acclaimed advertisement. By 1985, the high cost of its products and power
      struggles between executives caused problems. <br />
      Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably and pursued other ventures, while
      Jobs resigned bitterly and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977, without Wayne,
      who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak
      for $800 only twelve days after having co-founded Apple.Multimillionaire
      Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of
      US$250,000 (equivalent to $1,117,930 in 2021) to Jobs and Wozniak during
      the incorporation of Apple. During the first five years of operations,
      revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. <br />
      Between September 1977 and September 1980, yearly sales grew from $775,000
      to $118 million, an average annual growth rate of 533%.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Apple II, also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977,
      at the first West Coast Computer Faire. It differed from its major rivals,
      the TRS-80 and Commodore PET, because of its character cell-based color
      graphics and open architecture. While the Apple I and early Apple II
      models used ordinary audio cassette tapes as storage devices, they were
      superseded by the introduction of a 5+1‚ÅÑ4-inch floppy disk drive and
      interface called the Disk II in 1978.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first "killer
      application" of the business world: VisiCalc, a spreadsheet program
      released in 1979. VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and
      gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility
      with the office. Before VisiCalc, Apple had been a distant third place
      competitor to Commodore and Tandy. By the end of the 1970s, Apple had
      become the leading computer manufacturer in the United States.
